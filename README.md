# weather_app_2.0

Forget looking out of the window, all you need is this app to find out what Mother Nature is up to!

This app makes use of the OpenWeatherMap public API to retrieve weather data for cities around the world. Users will have the ability to search up any city of their choice and the app will display what the weather is currently like there. Is it raining in Paris? Is Syndey in the grips of another heatwave? Just how cold is it in Anchorage? The answers to these questions, and more, are only a single search away.

As a bonus feature, users will have the ability to switch between Celsius and (sigh..) Fahrenheit.

Enjoy!
